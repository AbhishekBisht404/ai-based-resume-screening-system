• Migrated a Microsoft Access database being used for many years by the Security Operations division to a newer AWS Web-based Python application, utilizing a PostgreSQL database, and a Microsoft Power BI dashboard for CBP employee and contractor separations. The Python code was developed using Visual Studio Code and versioned/stored in a Gitlab/AWS repository. The data came from many different CBP systems including LDAP servers, SAP, and Microsoft Sharepoint. This data was imported into the database using CSV files and direct API connections to applications. This dashboard allows the SECOPS team to easily compare separated employees and contractors with other data sources to make sure that the persons were correctly removed or moved within each system as needed. Testing was performed using Docker containers running Linux (RHEL) before migrating the code to a Jenkins pipeline where any vulnerabilities were discovered and sent back for remediation. Once clean, the code was pushed to a test environment for full peer testing. A full lifecycle change management process was used to test and then finally push the code to a production environment. Microsoft Sharepoint and Teams were used for internal Team communications while meeting and information was kept in Microsoft OneNote.
● Implemented a code vulnerability dashboard using a custom Python application to create integrations to many disparate external systems including Jira to show open tickets that have not been remediated. The data is presented in a set of Power BI dashboards and reports for review by SECOPS personnel and management. The system is used to validate that no vulnerabilities exist in software code. The data comes from many sources in the form of CSV and direct connection to external system APIs and databases. The Python code was developed using Visual Studio Code and versioned/stored in a Gitlab cloud (AWS) repository. A full lifecycle change management process was used to test and then finally push the code to a production environment.
● Used an AWS-hosted Jenkins pipeline to run software vulnerability analysis software such as SonarQube in Kubernetes containers. CSV files were kept in AWS S3 buckets and used the API to pull the data.
● Gitlab was used on the AWS cloud for use as a code repository and versioning of custom code.
● Created a lab environment using Docker Containers to test vulnerability applications such as SAST/DAST analysis software.
● Leveraged Jira for project / task management and reporting.
● Led a team of developers to help them develop new API integrations, process and procedure documentation, and software code analysis.
● Mentored junior team members to assist in building their skills as developers in Python and other disciplines.
● All processes and software application implementations were drafted in Microsoft OneNote and then cleaned up and placed on a Confluence site for Security Engineering personnel use and some was used for end-user training depending on the subject matter.

This is a sampler of the various lines of work experience and projects I’ve done for employers, clients, and my own interests. It begins with recent work and proceeds back in time. I hope you find it interesting.
Dan Clark Audio
DCA makes the world’s best headphones using Dan’s proprietary planar transducers. The project was to design a PCB to create a wireless Bluetooth-LE model capable of streaming audio at 96KHz / 24 bit. It used a Qualcomm Bluetooth chip which also contained two CPU cores and two DSP engines among other useful peripherals. This provided an I2S stream to an industry leading DAC from ESS. DCA’s transducers are notoriously difficult to drive, and it was found that none of the sensible small audio power amp ICs were capable of delivering the required performance. This obliged me to design a custom power amp with extraordinarily low distortion and noise, and low quiescent current as the system was powered by a lithium-ion battery.
Suite-E Guitars
Shortly after leaving Finisar, in early 2000, the pandemic struck, and everyone was locked down. An opportunity arose to spend some time doing something I always enjoyed, and that was amenable to working at home. I started a small business where I acquired worthy but slightly flawed guitars and basses and overhauled and hot rodded them. I developed techniques to transform them to be almost magical in the way they could inspire; they seemed to pull the music from the player’s fingers and imagination rather than the player having to coerce the music from the instrument. It paid the bills for a while, but as the pandemic abated, I also took on some freelance metal fabrication and machinist work, then eventually ended up working for Dan Clark.
Finisar Corporation
Frank Levinson, founder & CTO, hired me in 1999, about three hours into what was supposed to be a 45 minute interview. Most of that time was spent explaining Burning Man, and the conceptual process behind my first big art piece, Satan’s Calliope. The Calliope was a control systems thesis which involved nearly everything Frank was looking for someone to do at Finisar (except, of course, for the propane), including using the same microcontrollers Finisar was using at the time.
My first big assignment was to create a new method to obtain live, real time diagnostic information from fiber optic transceivers in a manner that was both easy for customers and palatable to competitors so it would be widely adopted. Lasers deteriorate with age, and used to have reliability issues, so early warning of incipient failure and tracking of gradual degradation was, and remains, a prime concern for large users. Monitoring of network link status has proven vital to running the whole internet at the level of availability and reliability expected by Lucy Hosking Curriculum Vitae 2025 05 05

everyone, and this was a fundamentally enabling technology to provide that reliability. The industry adopted it almost instantly and versions of the system propagated into all fiber optic telecommunication equipment in use to this day.
The best part of this is that it has generated over $160,000,000 in direct royalty payments to Finisar from their competitors (as of 2019). Less obvious, but equally important, is that it provided leverage for cross-licensing deals which saved Finisar vast sums in royalty payments to competitors.
This project was also a significant part of Finisar’s rise from a small upstart to becoming the dominant supplier of fiber optic transceivers worldwide. The cost of implementation using the available microcontrollers of the day was prohibitive, so we launched a project where I architected a series of custom ICs to implement it. One path was to get a microcontroller company to build a particular set of peripherals with their 8 bit CPU, and the other path was to create a programmable state machine. Our volumes were only a few million / year at the time and the big microcontroller companies weren’t interested, so we shelved that design and built a state machine version through Dallas/Maxim which became the DS1849/DS1852 (and the rest of the DS184X and DS185X series derivatives). Two versions were made: a full transceiver control system for Finisar and a hobbled version with just the monitoring functions for sale to Finisar’s competitors. Quite a few million units and a couple years later, Finisar hired their own IC design team. One of their early mandates was to implement my CPU-based architecture we shelved earlier. Instead of an 8 bit CPU, however, the project resulted in the sweetest dual-core 16 bit RISC CPU I’ve ever worked with. It was blazingly fast (for the time), tiny, and used amazingly little power. It has been integrated into every one of Finisar’s transceiver-on-a-chip IC designs. It has evolved ahead of the complexity of Finisar’s products and the commercial microcontroller market. I give great credit to the digital designer who implemented the gate level design for the CPUs and the surrounding logic.
I also participated heavily in defining the firmware design and coding standards for it. I’ve defined, designed the hardware, and coded all the closed loop control systems for: Laser power servos that cope with the non-linearities and other obnoxious behavior of VCSEL transmitters and their drivers; the detailed temperature compensation and thermal management of the lasers and of avalanche photodiodes used in some receivers; adaptive Electronic Dispersion Compensation equalizers using Least Mean Square, Stochastic Perturbation / Simultaneous Approach, and other coordinate descent algorithms, including dynamic compensation of offsets in the FFE and DFE tap multipliers, summers, and slicers. These products were shipping at 10’s of millions per quarter when I left Finisar, who at the time owned about 25% of the worldwide fiber optic transceiver market. These products set the standard for reliability and performance in that market. All the while this was going on, I also prosecuted a wide range of fiber optic transceiver designs using PIC, MSP-430, and ADuC7xxx controllers focused on high margin specialty Lucy Hosking Curriculum Vitae 2025 05 05

products. These included, among other things: Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing designs where one fiber carries many different channels on different wavelengths, much like broadcast radio, and in which the laser temperature must be controlled to 0.001 degrees C or better to maintain wavelength and must be held there for 20 years (of course with aging compensation for the laser). I created the first commercially successful DWDM SFP, and that design was still in production when I left Finisar. Early in my tenure, I had sole responsibility for CPU selection, creation of hardware platform reference designs, firmware, engineering GUI applications, and interface to the production test department. These designs were subsequently evolved and adapted by other teams for their products as the company grew. Many early discrete hardware implementations were absorbed into Finisar’s custom ICs as the IC team expanded and developed new products. As of my departure, most of their products have only one big IC in them and are still using the same methods. I was responsible for shepherding these concepts and methods through the IC team’s evolution and for keeping the institutional memory of these techniques. I initially created Windows GUI applications for each product and platform as my personal tools to develop the firmware and monitor and control the hardware. These proved invaluable for other teams in the R&D lab and Customer Service / Field Applications Engineering, and provided a template for automated production test development. Stripped- down versions were released to customers to assist their evaluation of our products. Starting small, with the DS1849 configuration and monitoring tool, they metastasized into massive product configuration management and tuning systems for each new product I worked on. The early versions were written in VB6, but most were written in C#, taking full advantage of the .NET platform, good Object Oriented methods, multi-threading, and the capabilities of the full Windows Forms model. I evolved methods to create windows quickly and efficiently with hundreds of controls and parameters whose access specifications changed with every new build of the transceiver code. Some of these products had over 5000 configuration items which had to be clearly displayed and managed, and the application had to be responsive and logically arranged to help infrequent and less expert users operate it effectively.
Considerable prior experience with audio mixing consoles and aircraft instrument panels guided the ergonomics of these complex window designs, control layouts, and user interface behaviors.
One of the great gaps in the Digital Optical Monitoring systems discussed above was that a given user may not own both ends of a link and may have no knowledge of the transceiver on the far end. This is not so much a problem inside a data center, where the user owns both ends of most links, but it is a serious issue for all geographically distributed networks and long-haul operations.
I developed a method to create an Out-Of-Band side channel so the transmitting device could send its diagnostic information to the receiver without interacting with the payload data Lucy Hosking Curriculum Vitae 2025 05 05

stream; each end of the link would exchange its status with the other end, and both users could know the conditions at the far end.
The bandwidth of the optical channels typically rolls off below about 100 KHz. A few percent amplitude modulation on the laser below this frequency has no effect on the payload data. I used Differential Manchester encoding at 5000 Baud to transfer packets of the transmitter’s diagnostic and identity information to the far end. This was easily implemented in firmware by an inner control loop in the laser power servo. Detecting it at the receiver was a bit more difficult. This, too, had to be a strictly firmware design, without any burden to the Bill of Materials cost. The existing analog received signal strength system was used as the source.
The ADC system I designed into our proprietary microcontroller had resources laid in at inception to make this possible. It provided 8X oversampling at the data rate and a variety of DSP operations were performed in firmware to create decent bit error rates. The Random Intensity Noise common in small lasers was a significant problem, but it was overcome with a little DSP.
The data from the far end of the link was presented to the user at the receiver in the same manner as the receiver’s natural diagnostic information, but at different memory locations. Some of Finisar’s newer TIA and Laser Driver ICs had circuitry to facilitate this, including a logarithmic signal strength detector to offload that burden from the firmware, and carefully controlled bandwidth in the received power sensing circuitry to improve Signal to Noise ratio. See US Patent 10,079,644 and its references. Another interesting project at Finisar was a channel monitor for DWDM optical links. This is a small, single-purpose, and very high update rate optical spectrum analyzer. Most optical spectrum analyzers use a diffraction grating and a moving mirror to sweep the spectrum across a single fixed sensor. This used a linear 1024 pixel photodiode array for a sensor and a fixed optical system where each pixel of the array responded to a specific wavelength; it had no moving parts. Sub-pixel resolution was possible with interpolation. The problem was driving the sensor array. It was an analog bucket-brigade shift register with quite insane strobing and gating requirements. I handled this with an Altera FPGA with their Nios processor. The FPGA managed the strobing and all other system and communication I/O, the Nios provided a 32 bit CPU for system intelligence, in the same chip. Patents and Patent Law
I am listed as Inventor on 79 issued U.S. Patents and an unknown number of related foreign patents in Europe and Asia. The great majority of these inventions are principally my work, sometimes with material contributions from other team members who are also listed. In a handful of cases, I made material contributions to work instigated by others. This has generated a disproportionately large return on investment for my employers. Lucy Hosking Curriculum Vitae

The two projects are: 1) The selection of a standard Global NGFW (Next Generation Firewall) and 2) the Global EAC (End-Point Access Control, i.e. Deployment of the 802.1x standard – NAC Network Access Control); equipment, software and methodology. The concept is to establish a system by which any device connecting to the Chevron Network would first require “Authentication” as a permitted unique device, and then “Authorization” to connect/reach its data, regardless where the user connected to the Network in the world. This all would occur prior to any application or database access control. The two projects, closely interrelated, needed to be managed separately, for their equipment and software manage two distinct aspects of security, as well as supported by two different groups of SME’s (Subject Matter Experts). Once the selection of the new NGFW and the concept of End-Point Access Control was truly verified in a series of Proof-of-Concept testing, these two projects would merge along with a third project the “Identity-based Access Policies” project into the single fourth project “Access Policies Enforcement” (APE).

BRITISH PETROLEUM, Houston, Texas – Contract – May 2011 to Jul 2012

Project Manager/Team Leader.
Came onboard as a contract Project Manager to work on various projects. One of these projects, working as DBA Team Lead, grew into a full-time job. Gained the “Trust” and “Respect” of the Team of DBAs. They feel comfortable approaching me with their concerns; trust my reasoning, suggestions, recommendations and/or solutions. Provided a single point of contact for users of DBA services for all issues and assignments. Any issue that is presented to Team Lead has immediate ownership. All DBA workloads are currently balanced providing a smooth operation. DBAs can request time-off and select which weekends and/or evenings to work. Cut down EWW and emergency workarounds and over-time. In order to achieve the above much work needed to be rejected and/or re-negotiated. DBAs now need not negotiate and\or hassle with users as to their assignments (users are now aware that the DBAs have someone who will step in support of them). Provided a single point for DBA Team Members to address their issues and concern to Wipro management.

IT Project Manager/Business Analyst.
As an immediate and available contract source have had the opportunity to assist various organizations on 1-3 day projects. Additionally, have been working and preparing for the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification exam from the Project Management Institute (PMI).

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION, Houston, Texas – Contract – Aug 2006 to Jun 2009

Project Manager/Business Analyst.
Established PMO methodologies documentation at the “Program Level” of a major 3-4 year “Tier 1” project, in a large Oil & Gas corporation.

Brought on board as a contract source to formalize established methodologies on this very large project. The project involved the replacement of the “bread & butter” ERP software (Landmark DIMS) that manages all wells from exploration & discovery through production and eventual possible abandonment. Having gone through the evaluation and selection process of the new software (The new WellView software from Peloton); the PM methodology documentation now involves all phases of the program from conception and planning through execution, delivery, production and support. The new implementation also required the integration with various other systems such as: CMS, Bengal, OFM, WellView Data Warehouse (master data management – Data Loss Prevention Strategies of sensitive data), Business Objects, etc. Additionally, using SharePoint 2007 I developed, implemented and maintained a Project Team website with six sub-websites. For the benefit of the new WellView community of users I also developed, implemented and maintained a WellView Community website with seven sub-websites providing information such as: Implementation and rollout schedules, FAQ’s, Training, Training materials, instructional videos, etc. Devon Energy transitioned from a legacy system to Clarity, and for the last two years I kept all of the WellView documentation and assisted BI&T executives in managing the program using Clarity and MS Project 2003. Used MS Visio Process Maps to manage our various IT cross functional teams delineating responsibilities between our IT teams and the user community teams. This involved all projects in Phase 2 (migrated) as well as all projects in Phases 3 and 4; a total of 11 projects.

STANFORD FINANCIAL GROUP, Houston, Texas – Contract – Sep 2004 to Oct 2005

Project Manager.
Implemented a banking system, data center and infrastructure for a new bank in South America with 14 branches, which opened in a record time of 6 months.

Brought on board as a contract source to lead a project in evaluating all available banking systems, and select the best “Universal Banking System” and/or vendor for all their international locations. This process initially entailed developing four different RFP’s for each of their types of banks, and selecting the final application/vendor from 83 vendors worldwide. With the assistance of outside unbiased consultants established and implemented an evaluation and elimination process that led to the final selection of “Temenos T24” as their single “Universal Banking System”.

Stanford Financial Group later purchased a commercial bank in Venezuela in order to expand their presence in that country. I was sent to Venezuela as Project Manager by the CIO to install a completely new IT system for the new bank, which meant lead and supervise the selection and implementation of a totally new banking system, infrastructure and data center that Mr. Stanford requested to be done in record time of four months. After my first analysis I informed Mr. Stanford and the CIO of my findings and that I would agree to a record time of 6 months (not 4 months) for the first phase (existing system). This process required the evaluation and selection of the best vendor/system for Venezuela and assist in all contract negotiations. The Oracle-based Abanks system from Arango was selected as a temporary solution. The Temenos solution would replace Abanks at a later date. Over a period of 37 weeks I traveled multiple times and I was in Venezuela for a total of 28 weeks. I assisted local bank management in the selection and hiring of all local IT personnel (some contract), purchasing and building a new data center, as well as managing the implementation of the new banking system, migrating current data and opening of branches; all carefully documented using MS Project and other project tools. The seven existing branches were transferred to the new system on time, and within two months after the seven additional branches outside of Caracas were opened. I also managed the installation and implementation of their new data center with SUN Microsystems servers as their core processors, a system of a Citrix servers farm to handle the new concept of “Thin Clients” being used at the branches, as well as their LAN, WAN and national network; all negotiated with the Venezuelan communications authority CANTV. The new system also included the implementation of Internet Banking, debit & credit cards, IVR (phone banking), and ATM’s with video security monitoring all of, which were not services provided by the original bank. Each of the various projects had budgeting considerations and preparation, as well as forecasting, and monitoring.

CALPINE CORPORATION, Houston, Texas – Contract – Jun 2004 to Aug 2004

Consultant/Business Analyst.
Brought on board as a contract source and PeopleSoft Financials SME to assist Calpine in generating a specific tree structure for their financial consolidations. This structure, with over 600 separate entities, required more than 160 consolidation nodes, each with its own “elimination” business units to allow the required specific “Legal Entity” consolidation, as opposed to their “Functional” or “Organizational” structure.
